                        <p>Not every borrower has an impressive credit score. Quite a few have bad credit scores because
                            of their past financial history. Some borrowers have limited or no credit history as well.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>The problem with low credit scores is that traditional financial institutions and
                                lenders generally do not lend to such borrowers with “bad credit.”</strong>&nbsp;Banks
                            use credit bureaus to check your credit report and then may find out that you are unworthy
                            by their standards.</p>
                        <p>So who can you turn to when you are in urgent need of cash? United Nation Loans can assist with
                            a wide range of payday and installment loans.</p>

                        <p>Loan companies for bad credit may claim to give you guaranteed approval. This is just not

                                but the lender still must be able to collect on the loan and will weed out anyone who
                                will not repay the loan.</strong></p>

                        <p>A poor credit loan can amount to a sum of $20 for each $90 you borrow. The exact amount is
                            not uniform across the USA, as each type of legislation can vary by state.</p>
                        <p>It may seem a lot if averaged over a year, but as they are short-term, they are actually
                            quite manageable. If you take into account the charges from other loans.</p>
                        <p>Late fees, prepayment penalties, and credit card</a> fees can mount up if you do not pay them
                            back on time. Always pay attention to your due date. Rates and terms will always be
                            stipulated before you sign.</p>
                        <p>Even though the loan does cost money, it’s an affordable alternative to overdraft charges,
                            credit card late fees, and bounced checks, especially when you can repay the loan as
                            scheduled.
